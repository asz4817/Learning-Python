Learn different Python packages with me!


I started with learning how to webscrape - beginning with the BeautifulSoup modules and converting them to pandas dataframes/csv files before transitioning into Selenium, which lets you interact with the page as well - clicking buttons and scraping information. 

I'm also starting to learn Flask for the backend of website devlopment, and have made a small todo-list project. 

Just stumbled across the gspread library, which works with the google sheets API to let us write into google sheets using Python!
